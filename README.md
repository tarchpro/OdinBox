### LICENSE
All main and sub-projects under OdinBox are distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. A copy of the license used is included in the root directory of the OdinBox repository.

### VERSIONING
OdinBox and all its sub-projects use the same versioning system to alert users to major and minor changes.

**ob-[sub-project]-v[major-version-number].[major-revision-number][minor-revision-letter]**

**Sub-Projects** are different softwares and include names like "nextcloud" "netbox" or "group"

**Major-Version-Numbers** are major changes to a project such as changes to a TUI, software compatability, or security profile options.

**Major-Revision-Numbers** are when either 26 minor revisions have elapsed, a new minor feature is impliemented, or security update is required.

**Minor-Revision-Numbers** are when quality/bug fixes are implimented.


### USAGE
To use OdinBox download either the specific sub-projects installation script, or download the combined installer script for multiple projects found in **ob-combined**.


### SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
OdinBox currently only supports Fedora 37. We have no plans for expanding into other operating systems as they do not meet our management standards for working with the cockpit web server manager.
